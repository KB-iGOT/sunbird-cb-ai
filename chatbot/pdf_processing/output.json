            "text": "1  INVITATION FOR BIDS \n\nTata Trusts (TT) is one of the oldest philanthropic institutions in India and has played \na  pioneering  role  in  bringing  about  an  enduring  difference  in  the  lives  of  the \ncommunities it serves. Under its Migration and Urban Habitat program, the TT has \npartnered  with  key  stakeholders  to  promote  sustainable  habitats  to  improve  their \nquality of life and address challenges. In the same umbrella, Tata Trusts has joined \nthe  hands  of  the  RERA  Committee  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  effective \nimplementation of the Real Estate Act, 2016. \n\nThe  Real  Estate  (Regulation  and  Development)  Act,  2016,  was  enacted  as  a \nconsumer-centric regulation addressing the many pain points of an unregulated yet \ngrowing  real  estate  sector.  The  Act  has  established  Real  Estate  Regulatory \nAuthorities (RERA) as well as Appellate Tribunals to regulate the creation of new real \nestate projects. The law has been successful in setting a regulatory framework for \nthe States. However, the implementation of the law in letter and spirit needs effective \nand transparent operational processes. \n\nTo automate the RERA operational processes, the TT has been mandated to provide \nthe software platform comprising two parts;  \n\n\u2022  PART A: RERA Core Application  Platform (For buyers, builders, agents, and \nRERA  Authorities  functionalities  such  as  Registration,  Approvals,  Updates, \nDashboards,  Analytics,  Notifications,  Document  Management,  Workflow \nManagement,  Grievance,  Complaints,  and  more)  to  be  used  by  individual \nRERAs.) \n\n\u2022  PART  B:  Inter  RERA  Open  Platform  (Data  Management,  Data  Sharing, \nAnalytics, and more) for data/information exchange with the individual RERA \napplications.) \n\nThe  proposed  platform  will  be  hosted,  maintained,  and  used  by  the  Delhi  and \nChandigarh (D&C) RERA as the first adopter. In the spirit of creating a public good, \nTT/D&C RERA may share core application with other state RERAs and enable them \nto  also  benefit  from  it.  The  developing  partner  would  also  create  a  \u201csandbox \nenvironment\u201d for other states RERAs to trial the platform in a secure environment \nhosted by D&C RERA. \n\nTT invites reputed development partners to independently quote for both of the above \nplatforms using open source technologies, modular micro-services architecture, and \ninteroperable  data  design  principles.  These  platforms  would  allow  homebuyers  to \ntransact  efficiently,  builders  to  comply  with  regulations  in  a  more  transparent \nmanner, and enable authorities to perform their regulatory duties more efficiently. \n\nPlease note that this bid document is not for an actual award of contract/work order. \nThe actual award of the contract will follow the conditions as per this document. This \ndocument is given for enabling the bidders to know the tender terms to guide them \nin filling up the bid and the quoting rates for the development and maintenance of \nthe proposed solution.  \n\nThe development partner will be selected using the Quality and Cost Based \nSelection (QCBS) process, which entails the evaluation of both technical and \nfinancial proposals. \n\nPage 10 of 68                                                                                            Proprietary & Confidential \n\n \n \n\f",
